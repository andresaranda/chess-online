Realtime Multiplayer Chess

Portfolio project built from scratch with no libraries or frameworks on JavaScript with node.js, express and socket.io
The front-end was made with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
The back-end was made on node.js with express and includes a complete game engine that checks everything from en passant to dead positions.
Both use socket.io for communication.
