REALTIME MULTIPLAYER CHESS
<br>

Portfolio project built from scratch with no chess libraries or frameworks on JavaScript with node.js, express and socket.io

The front-end was made with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The back-end was made on node.js with express and includes a complete game engine that checks everything including en passant captures and dead positions.

Both use socket.io for communication.
